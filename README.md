# BibTeX-to-MD

A versatile script that converts and cleans BibTeX files, renaming them to `.bib.md` for embedding in Obsidian, and wrapping them in "```bibtex / ```" code for rendering with the Pretty-BibTeX plugin.

## To do

Finish fixing description/readme.
Add future directions.
Add notes on known bugs
Explain integration use case with obsidian
Explain usage with task scheduler/hotkeys/obsidian script launcher
etc.

## Description

This script processes BibTeX files, adding emojis to entry types and cleaning up the `note` field. The output files are saved as Markdown files with the `.bib.md` extension, making them suitable for embedding in Obsidian.

## Features

- Converts BibTeX files to Markdown with `.bib.md` extension
- Adds emojis to entry types for better visualization (note: currently only articles and books have emojis, but you can add them to the library yourself directly in the script.)
- Removes any field not matching those specified in the script (by default, only author, title, journaltitle, and doi are enabled. This can be modified simply by adding the field name where those are mentioned in the script.)
- Cleans up the `note` field and replaces it with "YES"
- Copies the citekey to the bottom and checks if the citekey has an @ symbol, if not, it will add one (for usage with Pandoc Reference List and other Obsidian plugins that identify citekeys in notes)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Update the `input_directory` and `output_directory` variables in the script with the appropriate paths:

   ```python
   input_directory = 'path/to/source/bibs'
   output_directory = 'path/to/obsidian/output/folder'
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```
   python bibtex_to_md.py
   ```

3. The processed `.bib.md` files will be saved in the specified output directory.

## Example

Input BibTeX file:

```
@article{Doe.2021,
  author = {Doe, John},
  title = {A great paper},
  journaltitle = {Journal of Great Papers},
  date = {2016-05-03},
  pages = {5119--5124},
  doi = {10.1234/5678},
  note = {This is a note},
}
```

Output Markdown file:

```bibtex
@ðŸ“„article{Doe.2021,
  author = {Doe, John},
  title = {A great paper},
  journaltitle = {Journal of Great Papers},
  doi = {10.1234/5678},
  note = {YES},
}
```
@Doe2021
