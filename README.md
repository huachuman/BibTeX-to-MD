# BibTeX-to-MD

A versatile script that converts and cleans BibTeX files, renaming them to `.bib.md` for embedding in Obsidian, and wrapping them in backticks for rendering with the Pretty-BibTeX plugin. You can use this to get access to your Zotero collections from within Obsidian. Just export your collection, select "keep updated", and save it in the script's input folder. I have a folder in my documents called "Bibliographies" for this purpose. Run the script whenever you want to sync your exported collections to Obsidian, or set it on a daily schedule using Windows' built-in Task Scheduler.

## To do

- Finish fixing description/readme.
- Add future directions.
- Add notes on known bugs
- Explain integration use case with obsidian
- Explain usage with task scheduler/hotkeys/obsidian script launcher
- etc.

## Features

- Converts BibTeX files to Markdown with `.bib.md` extension
- Adds emojis to entry types for better visualization (note: currently only articles and books have emojis, but you can add anything you want to the library yourself directly in the script.)
- Removes any field not matching those specified in the script (by default, only author, title, journaltitle, and doi are enabled. This can be modified simply by adding the field name where those are mentioned in the script.)
- If it includes notes, it will be replaced with "YES". Currently can't figure out how to clean notes but plan on fixing this and possibly making it collapsible. 
- Copies the citekey to the bottom and checks if the citekey has an @ symbol, if not, it will add one (for usage with Pandoc Reference List and other Obsidian plugins that identify citekeys in notes)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Update the `input_directory` and `output_directory` variables in the script with the appropriate paths:

   ```python
   input_directory = 'path/to/source/bibs'
   output_directory = 'path/to/obsidian/output/folder'
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```
   python bibtex-to-md.py
   ```

3. The processed `.bib.md` files will be saved in the specified output directory.

## Example

Input BibTeX file:

```
@article{Doe.2021,
  author = {Doe, John},
  title = {A great paper},
  journaltitle = {Journal of Great Papers},
  date = {2016-05-03},
  pages = {5119--5124},
  doi = {10.1234/5678},
  note = {This is a note},
}
```

Output Markdown file:

```bibtex
@ðŸ“„article{Doe.2021,
  author = {Doe, John},
  title = {A great paper},
  journaltitle = {Journal of Great Papers},
  doi = {10.1234/5678},
  note = {YES},
}
```
@Doe2021
